# pd_site
This is my project for Code Louisville's front end web development class.
I used the bootstrap framework to re-do page by page my current employer's website. 
On each page there is a link to the original page that has been redone in the jumbotron.
The find my courtdate feature is something I'd like to work on learning how to implement but currently it's only function is to display an alert message on click that tells the user the feature will be available soon(jquery).
I also used JQuery for a button on my "contact" page to open the user's default email and populate starting content for that email.
This project is a work in progress.
